# Image Classification ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition))

**Fine-tuning a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify dogs and cats with high accuracy.**

This project applies deep learning to a classic Kaggle image classification challenge. Using transfer learning, I fine-tuned an Xception CNN architecture in Keras (TensorFlow) on 37,500 labeled images. The model was trained with data augmentation and evaluated using log loss (0.04958), achieving results comparable to the top 20% of competition submissions.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights
- Transfer learning for binary image classification
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Model tuning and evaluation with log loss
